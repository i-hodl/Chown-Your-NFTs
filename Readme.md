## What Does This Do?

Ever worry that your precious NFTs might go poof if the platform you minted them on suddenly decides to exit stage left? With this code, you can put those fears to bed, permanently. üõå
Our script fetches the original metadata and media associated with your NFTs and pins them to IPFS, using the exact same CID as the original. So even if your minting platform decides to take an unplanned vacation, your NFTs will keep partying on, immortal and unstoppable. üéâ
In simpler terms: We make sure your NFTs are as resilient as a cockroach at a nuclear test site. ü™≥
